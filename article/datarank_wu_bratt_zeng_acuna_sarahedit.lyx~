\begin_layout Abstract
A citation is a well-established mechanism for connecting scientific artifacts.
 Citation networks are used by citation analysis for a variety of reasons,
 prominently to give credit to scientists’ work.
 However, because of current citation practices, scientists tend to cite
 only publications, leaving out other types of artifacts such as datasets.
 Yet datasets are increasingly reused and experimented with, indicating
 their utility as an important part of the scientific enterprise, even while
 they tend to go unrecognized in citation practices.
 In this article, we examine several approaches for assigning credit to
 datasets, given the lack of systematic mechanisms for citing datasets.
 We develop a network flow measure, called DATARANK, that assigns a relative
 value to each node in the network, which accounts for the different properties
 of datasets compared to publications by treating publications and datasets
 differently.
 Specifically, DATARANK is a random walker that 1) starts at a node with
 exponentially decaying probability as a function of age and 2) randomly
 jumps to nodes differently depending on whether they are a publication
 or a dataset.
 We evaluate the quality of DATARANK by predicting the accuracy based on
 two dataset usage networks: web visits to GenBank datasets and downloads
 of FigShare datasets.
 We show that DATARANK is significantly better at predicting real usage
 of datasets when compared to PAGERANK and other variants.
 Our results suggest that even though the dataset networks we use represent
 different scientific disciplines, they follow similar usage dynamics.
 We also find that the decay rate in publication-citation networks is about
 twenty-times faster than of dataset-usage networks, suggesting____.
 We discuss the implication of these findings and improvements to citation
 behavior and algorithms to properly track and assign credit to the usage
 of datasets.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Citation networks play a crucial role in the decisions and processes of
 science.
 Citations indicate use, often proxy for quality, reflect impact, give credit,
 and can signal the relevance of content.
 Citations also inform tenure, promotion, and hiring decisions, where 'publish
 or perish' is not an empty aphorism but the de facto reward system.
 Furthermore, scientists themselves make decisions based on citations, such
 as what papers to read and which articles to cite.
 Scientific citations, then, have several purposes and function on multiple
 social and technical levels\SpecialChar endofsentence
 Citation practices and processes are relatively
 well-developed when it comes to scientific publications such as journal
 articles and conference proceedings.
 There are well-estabished citation infrastructures for publications.
 By 'citation infrasturcture' we refer to not only the physical systems
 underlying and enabling citations, but also the cyberinfrasturcture, informatio
n systems, metadata standards, publishing policies, and the social conventions
 of attribution and credit-assignment.
 Such infrastructure includes citation policies, processes, software, and
 social norms, and other formal and informal mechanisms of referencing a
 scientific artifact.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, some artifacts of science lack robust citation infrastructure.
 One of these artifacts is research datasets.
 Previous research has underscored this lack, describing how citations to
 datasets are still not as prevalent in credit-assignment practices as they
 should be

and that although datasets are an increasingly important asset in scientific
 production, they do not yet get the credit they deserve
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "sieber1995not,darby2012enabling"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Historically, the challenges with establishing citation infrastructures
 for research datasets has been multifactorial, with social and technical
 issues alike.
 First, the massive size of research datasets makes them prohivitive for
 archiving and searching.
 Second, datasets cost time and labor to prepare and to share, resulting
 in some articles failing to provide datasets
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "alsheikh2011public"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Third, scholars are not used to citing datasets.
 Although survey research has suggested that formal citation is considered
 by scholars to be the way of crediting a dataset
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "kratz2015researcher"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, scientists tend to cite the article describing the dataset, the subsets
 of data, or merely mention the dataset without explicit reference

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several attempts to promote the development of standards for dataset citation

, for instance, assigning specific DOIs to datasets to mitigate differences
 between datasets and articles

 and identifying datasets used in articles but not properly referenced automatic

.
 But there are many gaps which remain.
 The implications of the gaps in citation infrastructure for datasets are
 severe.
 For one, datasets citation enables scientists to create reproducible content
 or carry out further research
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "altman2013evolution"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Moreover, datasets tend to not appear in top inforation search and query
 results at the same scale as publications, resulting in datasets contributors
 lacking the use and assignment of credit that publications benefit.
 Third, the datasets usage statistics are underdeveloped and underexploited
 which inhibits better dataset curation and service to the scientific community
 of users by indicating the interest, relevance, or value of a dataset to
 the community.
 Worse still, as the age of the article grows, datasets loss is severe,
 which is leading to a rapid decline in the availability of research datasets

\begin_layout Standard
In this article, we develop a method for assigning credit to datasets from
 citation networks of publications.
 The method does not rely on scientists explicitly citing a dataset but
 infers the use and assigns credit accordingly based on a modified pagerank
 approach.
 We adapt the work done in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 in the context of dataset and publication citation networks.
 Our method that simulates the a random walker in a citation graph that
 takes into account the differences between obsolescence rates of publications
 and datasets, and estimates the DataRank, or score of each dataset.
 The data we use to develop this method is the metadata from National Center
 for Bioinformatics (NCBI) GenBank nucleic acid sequence data and publications
 associated with them; Microsoft Academic Graph publication citation metadata,
 Figshare datasets, and OpenCitationCorpus.
 We estimate the relative rank of the datasets with the DataRank algorithm
 and cross-validate it using the actual visits to the NCBI dataset web pages
 containing the description of the datasets — as close to real dataset use
 as we could get given the availability of NCBI dataset use data and analytics.
 When compared to the simple citations that we are able to predict for the
 dataset submissions, we show that our method is significantly better at
 making the visits prediction.
 We discuss the implications of our method for data citation infrastructures
 and future projects.

From a previous project with collaborators which parsed the GenBank metadata
 into a relational database (excluding the actual sequence data in the ORIGIN
 field, comprising approximately 80% of the GenBank database's total size)
 and disambiguated the author names, for the task of data here we selected
 the ACCESSION field and the relevant information from the REFERENCE field.
 The ACCESSION field is the identifier in for data submissions to GenBank
 or affiliate databases and from the REFERENCE field we used authors, title,
 journal and pubmed.
 The entry of 'Direct Submission' in the REFERENCE field indicates that
 the annotation record is describing a dataset (rather than a publication).
 The field of JOURNAL often contains the date that the dataset was submitted
 (e.g.

), an item we extracted to be used in the decay rate part of our algorithm.
 We queried the GenBank database with a resulant 212,260,377 gene sequences
 (version 230).
 Because the GenBank dataset only had the PubMed Identification number (PMID)
 of the publications and not the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) which was
 necessary to connect the GenBank metadata to the Microsoft Academic Graph
 (MAG) citation data, we converted the PMID of the GenBank dataset submissions'
 affiliated publications to the publications' DOI, and joined the MAG citation
 data to the GenBank data through a union of DOI to DOI.
 At the conclusion of the data processing, a total of 25,888,648 gene sequences
 from GenBank and 32,353,710 citations from MAG, which supply us with the
 citation network containing datasets and their affiliated cited publications.

 FigShare represents a mainstream repository that allows for the deposit
 of versatile resources.
 To encourage data sharing, free storage space is unlimited if the content
 is made public, while storage space has limits for private use.
 When a user makes a resource publicly available, FigShare immediately assigns
 a DOI to this resource, marked as a FigShare object by embedding the character
 string 'FigShare' within the DOI, e.g., 'https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6741260.'
 We can leverage this feature to determine whether a DOI is from FigShare.

 It is constructed from the semantic web to create an open repository for

 OCC provides citation data that others are able to build upon freely and

 and database access limits 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Because OCC is already formatted in the form of directed relationships
 between two DOIs, it is easy to transform the citation into a graph.
 For example, if there are three DOIs: 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{i},D_{j}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{k}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{i}$
\end_inset

 cites both 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{j}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{k}$
\end_inset

, we will get two records in OCC, the first one is 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{i}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{j}$
\end_inset

, and second is 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{i}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{k}$
\end_inset

, this kind of data.
 Under these circumstances, the only thing we need to do is to make sure
 when the node, that is, the DOI, is created.
 We acquire this information through OpenCitation and Microsoft Academic

Download Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our analysis, we aimed to find whether the estimation of the rank of
 a dataset (calculated using our modified network traffic estimation algorithm,
 DataRank) is related to something important about the submissions.
 In this study, we use the downloads of the submissions as a proxy for such
 importance.
 A portion of the DOIs (about 949) in OCC comes from FigShare.
 We crawled the downloads and the creation time of every FigShare DOI through
 the website: https://stats.figshare.com/total/downloads/article.
 The National Institutes of Health (NIH) provided download data for the
 month of September 2012 for the top 1000 Nucleotide GenBank entries 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "benson2012genbank"

\end_inset

.
 With this information, we were able to partially validate how our estimation
 of importance might be related to some external factor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the download data of FigShare and GenBank, we plotted probability
 density functions (pdf) of them respectively in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:pdf-of-figshare"

caps "false"

\end_inset

.
 Because of the limited amount of data, the disturbance of small downloads
 is relatively large, which we can clearly see from the figures' left side.
 The right part of the data tends to be flat, mainly due to the long tail
 phenomenon, which means comparing with normal datasets, datasets that have
 been frequently downloaded are pretty small.
 Exclude these two pieces of data, we can find that the points in the figure
 clearly show a linear correlation.
 This means the download probability of a dataset is predictable, which
 makes our mission possible.

Construction of the citation network
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We constructed a directed network of citations primarily using the OpenCitation
 Corpus, but combined with the affiliation between dataset and paper which
 was extracted from GenBank as mentioned above.
 The result is a sizable citation network.
 In this citation network, each node represents one dataset or paper.
 The directed edges represent the citation relations between nodes.
 OpenCitation Corpus consists of 441,432,288 citations and 44,229,769 unique
 resources, including 949 resources and 1335 citations from FigShare.
 After Integrated with GenBank, we finally get 473,785,998 citations and
 70,138,538 unique resources.
 On average, each paper will be cited by 9.98 papers, but when it switches
 to FigShare and GenBank, the number drops dramatically
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

to 1.41 and 1.25.
 This also suggests less of an emphasis on performing dataset citations.
\end_layout

For the purpose of exploring this network more intuitively, we sample about
 1 thousand nodes 1.5 thousand edges from the network and show it in

We adapt the network model proposed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 This method is inspired by PageRank by addressing the issue that citation
 networks are always directed back in time.
 In that model, each vertex in the graph was a publication but in our case,
 a vertex can be either a publication or a dataset.
 Our goal is to propagate a vertex's impact through its citation.

\begin_layout Standard
This method simulates a set of researchers traversing publications through
 the citation networks.
 It ranks publications by estimating the average path length taken by researcher
s who randomly start from a publication as a function of the publication's
 age and have a probability of stopping at each node.
 Mathematically, it defines a traffic function 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}(\tau_{\text{pub}},\alpha)$
\end_inset

 for a given paper.
 A starting paper is selected randomly with a probability that exponentially
 decays with a characteristic 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{\text{paper}}$
\end_inset

.
 Each time the research moves, it can stop with a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 or continue the search through the citation network with a probability
 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 The predicted traffic 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}$
\end_inset

 is proportional to the rate at which the paper is accessed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concrete functional form that it proposes is as follows.
 The probability of starting at the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th node is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho_{i}=\exp\left(-\frac{\text{age}_{i}}{\tau_{\text{pub}}}\right)\label{eq:starting-probability}

Then,

In this article, we do a simple extension of the previously described procedure
 in what we call 
\shape smallcaps
DataRank
\shape default
.
 The extension considers that the probability of staring at any single node
 should depend on whether the node is a publication or a datasets.
 This is, publications and datasets may vary in their relevant period, with
 publications generally becoming obsolete sooner than publications.
 Mathematically, we redefine the starting probability of the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th node as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho_{i}^{\text{DataRank}}=\begin{cases}
\exp\left(-\frac{\text{age}_{i}}{\tau_{\text{pub}}}\right) & \text{if \ensuremath{i} is a publication}\\
\exp\left(-\frac{\text{age}_{i}}{\tau_{\text{dataset}}}\right) & \text{\text{if \ensuremath{i} is a dataset}}
\end{cases}\label{eq:data-rank-starting}

 After initializing, we can easily found that nodes of the same type and
 same age have the same value, and meanwhile, the younger a node is the
 bigger its value.

 a node 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}^{\text{DataRank}}(\tau_{\text{pub}},\tau_{\text{dataset}},\alpha)$

 depends on three parameters that should be found by cross-validation with
 the rest of the components of the method remaining the same (e.g.,

 a probability

 But actually, there may exist a third choice, to continue its search through
 paper who cites it.
 In other words, the research can move on in two directions: forwardly and
 backwardly.
 we call this modified method

PageRank
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PageRank is a well known and widely used webpage ranking algorithm proposed
 by Google, it uses the topological structure of the web to determines the
 importance of a webpage which is totally independent of its content
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bianchini2005inside"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 It's an iterative algorithm.
 Firstly, it builds a network of the web through the link between webpages,
 each webpage will be assigned an initial value evenly, then updates the
 value of each webpage based on the link relations, which will eventually
 converge on a certain value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mathematical formation of PageRank is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
PR(p_{i})=\frac{1-d}{N}+d\underset{p_{j}\in M(p_{i})}{\sum\frac{PR(p_{j})}{L(p_{j})}}\label{eq:pagerank-algorithm}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1},p_{2},\cdots,p_{N}$
\end_inset

are the webpages whose importance need to be calculated, 
\begin_inset Formula $M(p_{i})$
\end_inset

 is the set of webpages that has a link to page 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $L(p_{j})$
\end_inset

 is the number of outbound links on webpage 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{j}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

is the total number of webpages.
 The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is a dampening factor which ranges from 0 to 1 and is usually set to 0.85

\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1},p_{2},\cdots,p_{N}$
\end_inset

are still the nodes whose importance need to be calculated, 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{data}(p_{i})$
\end_inset

 is the set of datasets that has a link to page 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $M^{pub}(p_{i})$
\end_inset

 is the set of papers that has a link to page 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $L(p_{j})$
\end_inset

 is the number of outbound links on webpage 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{j}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{data},N_{pub}$
\end_inset

is the total size of datasets and paper collections respectively.
 The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{data}$
\end_inset

 is a damping factor for datasets and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{pub}$
\end_inset

 is a damping factor for paper sets.

We propose a new method to rank scientific datasets by bootstrapping on
 the information already contains in the publication citation network.
 We test our method on a genetic sequencing dataset known as GenBank and
 a online open access repository called FigShare, and we validated that
 the 
\shape smallcaps
DataRank
\shape default
—our method—is more predictive of the real traffic to the dataset entries
 than the number of publications the dataset has received.
 This new proposed method bootstrap on information already available to
 scientists.

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of this paper is to better evaluate the importance of datasets
 through the citation network.
 Compared with the mature citation mechanism of articles, the reference
 of the datasets is in its infancy.
 The challenges of datasets citation are mainly from two aspects: No clear
 standards for datasets citation and lack of incentive for dataset sharing.
 There are several proposals trying to solve the first problem while not
 much investigate on the second one, thus this research is dedicated to
 relief the second problem.
 Sharing datasets is a time-consuming and labor-consuming task, one way
 to promote this kind of work is to establish a suitable evaluation system
 so that scholars will feel that time and labor they invest can pay off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though there are many scholars agree and disagree with the use of citation
 to assess research ability and influence
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "moed1985use,diamond1986citation,martin1996use,seglen1997impact,wallin2005bibliometric"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, but in general, citation number or ranking are considered to have a direct
 connection with the research ability and influence, especially when compared
 with peer review
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "meho2007impact,piwowar2007sharing"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, when comes to datasets, most research publications fail to provide
 a normative or clear citation to dataset
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "altman2013evolution"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, so we choose downloads data as a substitution for citation numbers, this
 is a common metric for datasets
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "belter2014measuring"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 We choose the 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 as the metric to measure the connection between the algorithm's result
 and actual value.
 In Figure 5, our algorithm demonstrates a better predictive ability for
 data downloads compared with PageRank and modified PageRank.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our experiments, both results show that our algorithm works better than
 other algorithms.
 In order to minimize the difference in publications' year and type, our
 algorithm uses the year and type of a publication to initialize the value
 of a node.
 A previous study of the patent also tries to eliminate all the effects
 caused by year, field and year-field interaction through dividing the number
 of citation received by a certain patent by the corresponding year-field
 average number of citation of patents of each cohort in each field
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "hall2001nber"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This study wants to provide a solution for the comparability of citation
 counts at different times and different disciplines, however, this needs
 more analysis of variance components.
 Another dataset or repository(as mentioned in the article) evaluation method
 was carried out by Clarivate Analytics editors on the Data Citation Index(DCI)
 database
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "reuters2012repository"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 They consider factors like its publishing standards, editorial content
 and citation information about it, etc, mainly on the subject, editorial
 content and repository attributes, geographic origin and scope to determine
 its strengths and weakness.
 However, they are more concerned about the integrity or standardization
 of the dataset rather than the content of dataset itself and meanwhile
 it relies on professional background knowledge and is difficult to implement
 on a large scale.
 The NERC Science Information Strategy Data Citation and Publication project
 suggest using DOIs for citing datasets
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "callaghan2012making"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, because most scholars have already got used to using DOIs for citing papers,
 it's easy to convert from citing papers to citing datasets, then we can
 use various pre-existing citation metrics, without having to invent new
 ones.
 But the reference to a dataset is still unclear, this means more work needs
 to be done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PageRank is a well-known ranking algorithm to determines the importance
 of a webpage
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "page1999pagerank"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, it only uses the topological structure of the network without considering
 other information of a webpage, such as content, topic, etc.
 Considering the fact that there are two different types of nodes in our
 network, we extend the classical PageRank algorithm to accommodate two
 data types, which we call it Modified PageRank.
 Modified PageRank seems to have a slight improvement over PageRank(0.159
 over 0.157 in GenBank and 0.0509 over 0.0504 in FigShare).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is no significant difference between the results of DataRank and DataRank-
FB(0.239 in GenBank and 0.091 in FigShare).
 That is to say, in the process of importance propagation through citation,
 the effect of backward propagation is negligible compared with forwarding
 propagation, which also coincides with our perception.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also analyze the impact of different decay time.
 In Figure 5, orig is a special set of the parameter for DataRank
\series bold
\shape smallcaps
,
\series default
\shape default
 in which paper and dataset have the same decay time.
 The best result shows that the decay time of dataset is 20 years and paper
 is 1 year, this means that compared with paper, datasets are more durable.
 In Figure 6, we can clearly see that the greater the difference in the
 decay time of paper and datasets, the more significant the correlation
 coefficient will be.
 Though the trend differs in GenBank and FigShare, this may be related to
 some intrinsic attributes of the dataset itself.
 Because As a third party open source website, figshare allows the user
 upload anything without limitation, whereas GenBank will check the gene
 sequence and some other basic information about the gene sequence submitted
 by the submitter to ensure the normalization of the dataset.
 This innate character can partially account for the phenomenon.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Understanding how datasets are used is an important topic in science.
 Datasets are becoming crucial for the reproduction of results and the accelerat
ion of scientific discoveries.
 Scientists, however, tend to dismiss citing datasets and therefore we do
 not have a proper measurement of how impactful datasets are.
 Our method uses the publication-publication citation network to propagate
 the impact of the publication-dataset citation network.
 By using two databases of real dataset networks, our method is able to
 predict the actual usage of these datasets more accurately than other methods.
 Our results suggest that datasets have different citation dynamics to those
 of publications.
 In particular, they have a longer decay time.
 In sum, our study provides a prescriptive model to understand how citations
 interact in publication and dataset citation networks and provide a concrete
 method for correlating the rank to actual usage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some shortcomings in our study.
 In our Genbank dataset, we do not have a great deal of information on actual
 usage.
 There are 1000 records but we only have used for about 255 of them.
 For the Figshare dataset, while we do have a significantly larger dataset
 of usage, the datasets do not seem to be cited as often as in Genbank.
 However, the dynamics of both datasets are similar, leading us to believe
 that they are representative of the nature of citation behavior in datasets
 and publications.
 In the future, we will explore other data citation tracking datasets such
 as PANGEA, Animal QTLdb, and UK Data Archive.
 Thus, these shortcomings are somewhat diminished.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found that the nature of the correlation between datarank and usage was
 predictive but unintuitive.
 Specifically, for some parameter choices, datarank had the puzzling effect
 of finding a high but negative correlation between the rank and the usage
 amount.
 We use a predictive model to avoid this issue but we would like to explore
 the reasons behind the negative correlation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study advances an analysis of datasets and publications with novel ideas
 from network analysis.
 Our work puts together ideas from other popular network flow estimation
 algorithms such as PageRank
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "brin1998anatomy"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and Dylan Walker's algorithm
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "walker2007ranking"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Our method predicts significantly better the usage of datasets and also
 it provides interpretable parameters.
 For example, even when the two datasets are of different nature, we found
 that the best parameters coincide in that the best decay time for publication
 is around 1 year whereas for datasets is around 20 year.
 Therefore, this novel analysis is good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Science needs better ways to keep track of dataset usage.
 While scientists might potentially take a great amount of time to change
 their citation behavior, we could use techniques such as the one put forth
 in this article.
 Ultimately, the need for tracking datasets is only going to become more
 important and therefore we either need to adapt to this or miss the opportunity
 to make datasets first class citizens in science.
