\begin_layout Abstract
Information retrieval systems based on network properties have shown success
 for a number of applications, Google's PageRank being probably one of the
 best well-known.
 The success of these systems depends on nodes

 other nodes.
 This is a well-known and old practice in science when citing scientific
 articles.
 However, when scientists publish datasets, then there is comparatively
 much less emphasis in performing dataset citations.
 In this work, we adapt a network flow algorithm that accounts for the presence
 of datasets and which assigns a

\begin_layout Abstract
In this work, we report on preliminary work that adapts network algorithms
 to translate publication citations into data citations.
 We validate our method with real data and dataset usage.
 We show that it is possible to properly give credit to data submissions
 that do not have many direct citations but that are however is high use
 by the scientific community.
 We discuss the implications of our work and future directions.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Getting credit publishing scientific articles and datasets should be equally
 important if the same amount of effort is to be put into these two tasks.
 Previous researchers, however, have shown that citations to datasets is
 still not practiced as much as it should be [cite].
 A couple of the problems is that historically archiving and sharing of
 datasets has been much more difficult than sharing of scientific articles.
 Also, the sizes of datasets have kept increasing.
 However, citing dataset should still be important because dataset allow
 other scientists to create reproducible content [cite].
 In this article, we develop a method for assigning credit to dataset from
 the citation network of publications.
 Therefore, it does not rely on scientists explicitly citing dataset more
 than just the initial scientists.
 Giving credit to properly created dataset could therefore be made feasiable.

Credit assignmnent
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Datasets are an increasingly important asset of scientific production yet
 they do not get the credit they deserve.
 Several attempts have been made to correct this.
 Some of these attempts attempt to define alternatives to typical citation
 networks by looking at what is called 
\emph on
altmetrics
\emph default
 [cite].
 For example, 
\emph on
impactstory 
\emph default
[cite] is a company that aims at producing things that are important.

Requesting scientists to modify their behavior takes a long time to apply.

\begin_layout Standard
In this article, we adapt the work done in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "walker2007ranking"

\end_inset

.
 In particular, our method estimate the average length of a random walker
 to the graph network, which considers that the obsolenseance rate of publicatio
ns and datsets is different.
 Using a dataset of genbank submissions and the publications associated
 with them and the network of publications from the Microsoft Academic Graph,
 we estimate the rank of the datasets.
 We crossvalidate by using the actual visits to the web pages containing
 the description of the datasets â€” almost as close to reality as we could
 get.
 When compared to the simple citations that we are able to predict for the
 submissions, we show that our method is significatnly better at making
 the visits prediction.
 We discuss the implications of our method for future projects.

\begin_layout Subsection
Dataset
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We obtained a dataset of genbank data paired with the citation to these
 datasets, usually by the authors of the dataset.
 We additionally obtained the network of citations from Microsoft Academic
 Graph (MAG).
 A portion of these publications had their DOI associated with them.
 Because the genbank dataset only had the Pubmed IDs of the publications,
 we had to additionally find the link between the Pubmed IDs and the DOI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We hope to find that the measure of important we estiamte is related to
 something important about the submissions.
 In our case, we will use the visits to the submissions as a proxy for such
 important.
 The National Institutes of Health gratiously provided such data for the
 month of September 2012 for the top 200 Nucelotied genbank entries.
 With this information, we will be able to partially validated how our estimatio
n of important is related to something external.

A network model of datasets and publications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We adapt the network model proposed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In that model, each vertex in the graph was a publication but in our case
 a vertex can be either a publication or a dataset.
 Our goal is propagate.
