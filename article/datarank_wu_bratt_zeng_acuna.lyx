\begin_layout Abstract
A citation is a well-established mechanism for connecting scientific artifacts.
 Citation networks are used by citation analysis for a variety of reasons,
 prominently to give credit to scientistsâ€™ work.
 However, because of current citation practices, scientists tend to cite
 only publications, leaving out other types of artifacts such as datasets.
 Datasets then do not get appropriate credit even though they are increasingly
 reused and experimented with.
 We develop a network flow measure, called 
\shape smallcaps
DataRank
\shape default
, aimed at solving this gap.
 
\shape smallcaps
DataRank
\shape default
 assigns a relative value to each node in the network based on how citations
 flow through the graph, differentiating publication and dataset flow rates.
 We evaluate the quality of 
\shape smallcaps
DataRank
\shape default
 by estimating its accuracy at predicting the usage of real datasets: web
 visits to GenBank datasets and downloads of Figshare datasets.
 We show that 
\shape smallcaps
DataRank
\shape default
 is better at predicting this usage when compared to 
\shape smallcaps
PageRank
\shape default
 and other variants.
 Our results suggest that dataset databases follow a similar decay rate
 whereas publication citations decay twenty-times faster than dataset citations.
 We discuss improvements to citation behavior and algorithms to properly
 track and assign credit to datasets.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A citation network is an important source of analysis in science.
 Citations serve multiple purposes such as crediting an idea, signaling
 knowledge of the literature, or critiquing others' work 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "martyn1975citation"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 When citations are thought of as impact, they inform tenure, promotion,
 and hiring decisions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "meho2007impact"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, scientists themselves make decisions based on citations, such
 as which papers to read and which articles to cite.
 Citation practices and infrastructures are well-developed for journal articles
 and conference proceedings.
 However, there is much less development for dataset citation.
 This gap affects the increasingly important role they play in scientific
 reproducibility 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "task2013out,belter2014measuring,robinson2016analyzing,park2018informal"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, where studies use dataset to confirm or extend the results of other research
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "sieber1995not,darby2012enabling"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 One possible cause of this gap has been the historical difficulty with
 archiving datasets.
 While these difficulties are less prominent today, the citation practices
 for datasets take time to develop.
 One possible solution to this gap is to develop better algorithmic approaches
 to track dataset usage.
 In this work, we hypothesize that a network flow algorithm could track
 usage more effectively if it propagates publication and dataset citations
 differently.
 With the implementation of this algorithm, then, it will be possible to
 account for the differences in citation behavior between these two types
 of artifacts, increasing the importance of datasets as first class citizens
 of science.

 introduced an approach called

 for rating scholars.
 This method updates the rating of scholars based on the relative rating
 of the citing and cited scholars at the time of the citation.
 Citation networks are an important source of information for ranking homogenous
 types of nodes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Historically, the use of citation networks for ranking datasets has been
 significantly more challenging.
 These challenges have social and technical issues alike.
 First, the massive size of research datasets has made them prohibitive
 for archiving and searching.
 Second, datasets cost time and labor to prepare and to share, resulting
 in some articles failing to provide datasets 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "alsheikh2011public"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Third, scholars are not used to citing datasets.
 Although survey research has suggested that a formal citation is considered
 by scholars to be the way of crediting a dataset 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "kratz2015researcher"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, scientists tend to cite the 
\emph on
article
\emph default
 rather than the dataset or they merely mention the dataset without explicit
 reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "force2014encouraging"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, these historical reasons have prevented the proper assignment
 of credit to dataset usage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several attempts to improve citation practices for datasets and to modify
 citation networks have been established.
 In 2014, the Joint Declaration Of Data Citation Principles was officially
 released.
 These principles, however, mainly focus on normalizing dataset references
 rather than normalizing storage and some other technical issues 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "altman2015introduction,callaghan2014joint,mooney2012anatomy"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 For instance, some researchers have suggested assigning specific DOIs to
 datasets to mitigate differences between datasets and articles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "callaghan2012making"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Others have proposed to automatically identify uncited or unreferenced
 datasets used in articles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "boland2012identifying,kafkas2013database,ghavimi2016identifying"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 All these solutions try to make citation dataset behavior more standard
 or attempt to fix the citation network by estimating which data nodes are
 missing.
 Therefore, these solutions necessarily modify the source that algorithms
 use to estimate impact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this article, we develop a method for assigning credit to datasets from
 citation networks of publications, assuming that they have biases.
 Importantly, our method does not modify the source data for the algorithms.
 The method does not rely on scientists explicitly citing a dataset but
 infers their usage, assigning credit based on a modified 
\shape smallcaps
PageRank
\shape default
 approach.
 We adapt the work by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "walker2007ranking"

\end_inset

 to include two types of nodes: datasets and publications.
 Our method simulates a random walker that takes into account the differences
 between obsolescence rates of publications and datasets, and estimates
 the score of each datasetâ€”the 
\shape smallcaps
DataRank
\shape default
.
 The data we use to validate this method is the metadata from the National
 Center for Bioinformatics (NCBI) GenBank nucleic acid sequence and Figshare
 datasets.
 We estimate the relative rank of the datasets with the 
\shape smallcaps
DataRank
\shape default
 algorithm and cross-validate it by predicting the actual usage of themâ€”number
 of visits to the NCBI dataset web pages and downloads of Figshare datasets.
 We show that our method is better at predicting both types of usages.
 We discuss the implications of our method for data citation infrastructures
 and future projects.

 It contains approximately 450 million DOI-to-DOI citations.
 Specifically, COCI contains information describing a citation relationship,

 We processed 212,260,377 gene sequences in the dataset (version 230).
 Our citation database (described above) identifies nodes by their Digital

 Therefore, we used an additional PMID to DOI link dataset provided by PubMed.
 At the end, this left us with 25,888,648 gene sequences from GenBank datasets

.
 To encourage data sharing, free storage space is unlimited if the content
 is made public, while storage space has limits for private use.
 When a user makes a resource publicly available, Figshare immediately assigns
 a DOI to this resource, marked as a Figshare object by embedding the character
 string 'figshare' within the DOI, e.g., 'm9.figshare.6741260.' We can leverage
 this feature to determine whether a publication cites a dataset by detecting
 Figshare-generated DOIs.

 However, only a very small portion of those DOIs (about 949) are ever cited

Construction of citation network

\begin_layout Standard
We constructed a directed network of citations primarily using the OpenCitations
 Index, but combined with the affiliation between dataset and paper which
 was extracted from GenBank as mentioned above.
 The result is a sizable citation network.
 In this citation network, each node represents one dataset or paper.
 The directed edges represent the citation relations between nodes.
 OpenCitations Index consists of 441,432,288 citations and 44,229,769 unique
 resources, including 949 resources and 1335 citations from Figshare.
 After Integrated with GenBank, we finally get 473,785,998 citations and
 70,138,538 unique resources.
 On average, each paper will be cited by 9.98 papers, but when it switches
 to Figshare and GenBank, the number drops dramatically to 1.41 and 1.25.
 This also suggests less of an emphasis on performing dataset citations.

 It ranks publications by estimating the average path length taken by researcher
s who traverses the network considering the age of resources and a stopping

 Mathematically, it defines a traffic function 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}(\tau_{\text{pub}},\alpha)$

 A starting paper is selected randomly with a probability that exponentially
 decays with a

 Each time the researcher moves, it can stop with a probability

 or continue the search through the citation network with a probability
 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\alpha$

 The predicted traffic

In our analysis, we aimed at finding whether the estimation of the rank
 of a dataset based on citation data is related to a real-world measure
 of relevance such as downloads.
 We propose a method for estimating this ranking considering differences
 in citation dynamics for publications and datasets.
 We also propose variants to this method, and compare all of them to standard
 ranking algorithms.
 We use the data of visits of GenBank datasets and downloads of Figshare
 datasets.
 Thus, we will investigate which of the methods works best for ranking them.

 In particular, we find that the highest correlation occurs when the difference
 is either -19 or 19, suggesting that both datasets have the same obsolescence
 differences between datasets and publications.
 Concretely, the highest correlation (although negative for GenBank) occurs
 when the datasets decay around 20 times slower than publications.
 Thus the parameters that we find offer some insight into the nature of
 publicationâ€“dataset networks.

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of this paper is to better evaluate the importance of datasets
 through the citation network.
 Compared with the mature citation mechanism of articles, referencing datasets
 is still in its infancy.
 Acknowledging the long time the practice of citing datasets will take to
 be adopted, our research aims at recovering the true importance of datasets
 even if their citations are biased compared to publications.

Scholars disagree on how to give credit to research outcomes.
 Regardless of how disputed citations are as a measure of credit

 Citations, however, are rarely used for datasets 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, giving these important research outcomes less credit that they might deserve.
 Our proposal aims at solving some of these issues by constructing a network
 flow that is able to successfully predict real usage better than other
 methods.
 While citations are not a perfect measure of credit, having a method that
 can estimate true citations is advantageous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Previous research has examined ways of normalizing the citations by time,
 field, and quality.
 This relates to our 
\shape smallcaps
DataRank
\shape default
 algorithm in that we are trying to normalize the citations by year and
 artifact type.
 Similar work has been done in patent citations: 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hall2001nber"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 attempt to eliminate the effects caused by year, field and year-field interacti
on through dividing the number of citation received by a certain patent
 by the corresponding year-field average number of citation of patents of
 each cohort in each field.
 Other researchers have gone beyond time and field by also attempting to
 control by quality of the resource.
 Clarivate Analytics editors consider other normalizing factors such as
 publishing standards, editorial content and citation information about
 it when creating the Data Citation Index (DCI) database 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 .
 However, a control like this requires significantly more manual curation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found that the practice of following who cites an artifact (i.e., backward
 propagation) is not important compared to following a cited artifact (i.e.,
 forward propagation).
 This is, the more specialized 
\shape smallcaps
DataRank-FB
\shape default
 model (see Methods) did not produce higher predictability.
 This lack of improvement could suggest that when scientists traverse the
 network of citations, they seem to only follow one direction of the graph
 (who cites what).
 This could be perhaps a limitation of the tools available to scientists
 to explore the citation network or because backward propagation changes
 constantly year after year.
 Initiatives that force the creation of identifiers (DOI) for datasets,
 such as the NERC Science Information Strategy Data Citation and Publication
 project 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

, might change this pattern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also analyze the impact of different decay times.
 In Fig.

 in which paper and dataset have the same decay time.
 The best result shows that the decay time of dataset is 20 years and paper
 is 1 year, meaning that compared with papers, datasets are more durable.
 In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:difference-in-decay"
plural "false"

\end_inset

, the greater the difference in the decay time of paper and datasets, the
 larger the absolute correlation coefficient becomes.
 Though the trend differs in GenBank and Figshare (i.e., one is positive and
 the other is negative), this may be related to some intrinsic attributes
 of the datasets themselves.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Understanding how datasets are used is an important topic in science.
 Datasets are becoming crucial for the reproduction of results and the accelerat
ion of scientific discoveries.
 Scientists, however, tend to dismiss citing datasets and therefore there
 is no proper measurement of how impactful datasets are.
 Our method uses the publication-publication citation network to propagate
 the impact of the publication-dataset citation network.
 Using two databases of real dataset networks, we demonstrate how our method
 is able to predict actual usage more accurately than other methods.
 Our results suggest that datasets have different citation dynamics to those
 of publications.
 In particular, they have a longer decay time.
 In sum, our study provides a prescriptive model to understand how citations
 interact in publication and dataset citation networks and gives a concrete
 method for producing ranks that are predictive of actual usage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some shortcomings in our study.
 In our GenBank dataset, we do not have a great deal of information on actual
 usage.
 There are 1000 records but we only located 255 in the publication network.
 For the Figshare dataset, while we do have a significantly larger dataset
 of usage, the datasets do not seem to be cited as often as in GenBank.
 However, the dynamics of both datasets are similar, leading us to believe
 that they are representative of the nature of citation behavior in general.
 In the future, we will explore other data repositories such as PANGEA,
 Animal QTLdb, and UK Data Archive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found that the nature of the correlation between 
\shape smallcaps
DataRank
\shape default
 and usage was predictive but somewhat puzzling.
 Specifically, for some parameter choices, 
\shape smallcaps
DataRank
\shape default
 had the effect of finding a high but negative correlation between the rank
 and the usage amount.
 We use a predictive model to avoid this issue but we would like to explore
 the reasons behind the negative correlation.
 We think that datasets that are well cited and have high 
\shape smallcaps
DataRank
\shape default
 are moved to their own data repositories.
 Therefore, some high 
\shape smallcaps
DataRank
\shape default
 dataset might have low usage on the official repositories we examined,
 leading to the puzzling result.
 In the future, we will confirm whether this high-datarank datasets are
 available elsewhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study advances an analysis of datasets and publications with novel ideas
 from network analysis.
 Our work puts together concepts from other popular network flow estimation
 algorithms such as 
\shape smallcaps
PageRank
\shape default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\shape smallcaps
NetworkFlow

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Our method predicts better the usage of datasets compared to 
\shape smallcaps
PageRank
\shape default
 and 
\shape smallcaps
NetworkFlow
\shape default
 and also it provides interpretable parameters.
 For example, even when the two datasets are of different nature, we consistentl
y found that the best decay time for publication is around 1 year whereas
 for datasets is around 20 year.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Science needs better ways to keep track of dataset usage.
 While scientists might potentially take a great amount of time to change
 their citation behavior, we could use techniques such as the one put forth
 in this article to accelerate the credit assignment for datasets.
 Ultimately, the need for tracking datasets will only become more pressing
 and therefore we must adapt or miss the opportunity to make datasets first-clas
s citizens of science.
